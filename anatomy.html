				<p>Ligers are very large cats & typically weigh-in around 700 pounds. There are reports of Liger’s weighing in at a whopping 1,000 pounds. Ligers, at shoulder-height stand on average 56 inches.</p>

				<p>Unique physical characteristics include tiger stripes, a moderate Lion’s mane, large lion-esque paws, & docile temperament as they are raised in captivity around humans their entire lives.</p>

				<p>Ligers breathe like normal mammals however there are rumors floating around the ‘iheartligers’ community of a Liger with gills & can actually extract small amounts of oxygen when placed under extreme circumstances (e.g. under water).</p>

				<p>Ligers continue to grow until they die and can live up to 10 years. Genetically modified Ligers can live up to 20 years however experience significant medical issues. It is important to note PETA has successfully lobbied to restrict breading of genetically modified Ligers.</p>
